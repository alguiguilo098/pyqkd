Currently the codes available are not yet in a form of any library or package ready to use in a plug&play style. However, soon I'll:
1) Clarify the distinction between the demonstrator and the parallel GA codes;
2) Add an "installation" step-by-step guide;
3) Create examples of use;
4) Upload the documentation;
5) Create a docker container.
